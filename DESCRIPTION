Description: A comprehensive toolkit for spatial analysis of Spanish mobility patterns 
    using MITMA (Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda) data. Provides 
    streamlined functions for data access, spatial analysis, and automatic map 
    generation with clear step-by-step messaging and memory-efficient processing. 
    All analysis functions automatically create spatial maps when geometries are 
    provided using sf package integration. Features include mobility data retrieval 
    with advanced filtering capabilities (by region, province, or specific zones), 
    spatial containment analysis, anomaly detection, machine learning prediction, 
    and interactive spatial visualizations. The package includes S3 classes for 
    structured analysis results with custom print and summary methods. A comprehensive 
    data analysis vignette demonstrates spatial mobility analysis with real Spanish 
    transportation data.
